# Milk-V Duo Resources
**English resources for Milk-V's Duo single board computer!**

_This guide is incomplete! Please feel free to leave a pull request to add more information. :)_

## Intro

I have recently purchased a [Milk-V Duo](https://milkv.io/duo) from China. Unfortunately due to the product's lack of official availability in other countries such as the US, most info and discussion about it is in mostly Chinese. I want to change this by providing English speakers with resources to easily work with the Duo.

## Plans for the future?

* Add community made boards
* Add English translated guides from the forums

## How to Buy

The Duo is not officially available in China as prevously mentioned. However, you can get them through third party sellers on AliExpress! Prices vary depending on what reseller you get them from, but they're usually like $10-15. Just look up "Milk-V" and you can find various listings for the board as well as resellers selling the IO board, which I would recommend getting.
